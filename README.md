# TestBrasilPrev
This project is a test to RSI
If you only want to run this code, you don't need to create a new environment, due no external package was used. 

But if you want to run the test, then I would recommend you to create a new environment and install the packages listed 
in requirements.txt by using the following command: 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`  

To run the code, you can only call python with _play.py_ and it will run ~~hopefully~~.

`python play.py`
